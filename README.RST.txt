6. About (Short Description / Summary):Historically, Embodied Conversational Agents(ECAs) have been used as virtual assistants that make easier the access to information or help in performing complex tasks.Due to their high computational requirements ECAs are usuallyrun on desktop computers, but with the recent development ofhand-held devices both in hardware and software, it becameeasy to move ECAs to that new mobile scenario. Thus,we propose an open-source based platform for developing ECAbased interfaces on Android-equipped devices. We also presenta prototype for controlling a home automation system
7. Install (Installation procedure): 
Step 1: Insatall the latest version of JAVA runtime Environment (version 7 or later).
Step 2: Install Eclipse (ADT) software to enable android in the device(prefered).
Step 3: Run Control Interface software.
Step 4: Android codings are executed by the option "Run as Android Application".
8. Usage (add instruction on how to use the app, or you can redirect to External link if you have one):- we can use this application for areas which need home automation that can be accessed from remote areas.
